## How can I contribute?

### Issues

We manage our contributions through [Issues](https://github.com/ephemeralenvironments/ephemeralenvironments/issues). If you see an open issue tagged `help wanted`, drop a comment with a brief description of how you plan to work on this, and we'll assign it to you.

If you have a bug report or feature request, open an issue using the appropriate template. If you would like us to assign the issue to you, tick the checkbox.

### Pull Requests

Branch names should adhere to the format `<type>/<name-of-issue>`, where `<type>` describes your contribution (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, etc.). 

Once you have ensured your branch works locally, open a PR back to this repo.
1. PR title should be formatted as `<type>: <Name of issue>`
