# Contributing to EphemeralEnvironments.io

As a growing community project, we always appreciate contributions. We're looking for:

1. **Content:** add to the existing `.md` feature guides, create a new guide, help with project documentation
2. **Code:** enhance the site with HTML/CSS/JS elements, create CI/CD pipelines, perform general maintenance
3. **Design:** create new infographics, assets, improve existing formatting

Whether this is your first time contributing or you're an OSS pro, we would love to have your help improving [EphemeralEnvironments.io](https://ephemeralenvironments.io)!

## How can I contribute?

### Issues

We manage our contributions through [Issues](https://github.com/ephemeralenvironments/ephemeralenvironments/issues). If you see an open issue tagged `help wanted`, drop a comment with a brief description of how you plan to work on this, and we'll assign it to you.

If you have a bug report or feature request, open an issue using the appropriate template. If you would like us to assign the issue to you, tick the checkbox.

### Pull Requests

Once you're assigned an issue, fork a copy of this repo and create a branch. 

Branch names should adhere to the format `<type>/<name-of-issue>`, where `<type>` describes your contribution (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, etc.). 

Once you have ensured your branch works locally, open a PR back to this repo.
1. PR title should be formatted as `<type>: <Name of issue>`
2. Include a brief description
3. Link to the open issue

A maintainer will request changes if necessary. For content contributions, don't forget to add your name to the **Content Contributors** section at the bottom of the `.md` file.
