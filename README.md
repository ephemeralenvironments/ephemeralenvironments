<a href="https://ephemeralenvironments.io" target="_blank">EphemeralEnvironments.io</a> is a resource for organizations who want to incorporate ephemeral environments into their dev workflows.

We've compiled a number of feature guides outlining best practices for setting up and using ephemeral environments, based on interviews with industry experts.
