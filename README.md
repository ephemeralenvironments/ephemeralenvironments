# PreviewEnvironments.io

PreviewEnvironments.io is a resource for organizations who want to incorporate preview environments into their dev workflows.

We've compiled a number of feature guides outlining best practices for setting up and using preview environments, based on interviews with industry experts.

## Project Background

PreviewEnvironments.io is a project started by [Shipyard](https://www.shipyard.build/). At Shipyard, we help your organization create and manage preview environments. With PreviewEnvironments.io, we want to highlight the wide range of applications for preview environments, and show how environments can help any organization simplify and streamline their dev workflow, regardless of size.

This project is still evolving and changing, and we will update it frequently with new, informative content on best practices for building and working with preview environments.
